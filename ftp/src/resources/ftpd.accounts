# account definition
# in AnomicFTPD we assign every users account to a group (see ftpd.groups)
# this file has the relation between the account, group
# and the users password
#
# syntax:
# <user>=<group>,<password>

# IMPORTANT!
# IN PRODUCTION, DELETE THESE EXAMPLES
# AND DEFINE YOUR OWN GROUPS AND ACCOUNTS
# TO PREVENT THAT UNWANTED CLIENTS CAN ACCESS
# YOUR COMPUTER USING THE STANDARD SETTINGS!

# demo accounts for Linux and Max OS
bob=usergroup,123password
bobm=usergroupmultipathmatch,123password

# demo accounts for Windows
jim=windowsusergroup,456password

# anonymous account, this account is used i.e. when accessed through a web browser
# without using a password. When ftpd is started, it generates an URL that can be
# used to access exactly this anonymous account here.
# Since the path notion for Windows-based and Linux/Mac OS computers are different,
# you must correct this path for Linux and Macintoshes
# by using a different user group with a correct path. (see commented line)
